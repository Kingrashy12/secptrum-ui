### Example

```bash
import styled from "styled-components";
import { Button } from 'secptrum-ui';

const CustomButton = styled(Button)`
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;

  &:hover {
    background-color: #0056b3;
  }
`;

function App() {
  return (
    <CustomButton>
      Customized Button
    </CustomButton>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## CLI Tool

SecptrumUI includes a CLI tool to help set up your Next.js project for use with `styled-components`. This tool automatically configures your project with the necessary files and settings.

- **_Note:_**
  This setup is specific to Next.js and provides detailed instructions for configuration.

### Setup the CLI Tool Locally

1. **Install Dependencies**

   First, ensure you have the `secptrum-ui` and `styled-components` packages installed:

   ```bash
   npm install secptrum-ui styled-components
   ```

2. **Run the Setup Command**

Navigate to your project directory and run the setup script:

```bash
 npx secptrum-setup setup
```

This command will perform the following actions:

- If the `src` Directory Exists: Creates a `lib/registry.tsx` (or `lib/registry.js` for JavaScript) inside the `src` directory if it doesn't already exist.

- If the `src` Directory Does Not Exist: Creates `lib/registry.tsx` (or `lib/registry.js`) in the root directory.

3. **Enable styled-components in next.config.js.**

```bash

module.exports = {
  compiler: {
    styledComponents: true,
  },
}

```

4. **Wrap the children of the root layout with the style registry component:**

- **Typescript:**

```bash
import StyledComponentsRegistry from './lib/registry'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <StyledComponentsRegistry>{children}</StyledComponentsRegistry>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

- **Javascript:**

```bash
import StyledComponentsRegistry from './lib/registry'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <StyledComponentsRegistry>{children}</StyledComponentsRegistry>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

These steps ensure that your project is properly configured for styled-components with Next.js, following the latest guidelines.
